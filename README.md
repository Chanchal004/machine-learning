# Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction

This project predicts tomato leaf diseases using a machine learning model. It uses a dataset from Kaggle (`kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf`) and trains a Decision Tree Classifier for the prediction.

---

## Features
- Download dataset directly from Kaggle using `kagglehub`.
- Data preprocessing and handling missing values.
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier.
- Evaluate the model with accuracy and classification report.
- Predict diseases for new samples.

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) set up in your environment.

### Required Libraries
Install the following libraries before running the code:
```bash
pip install kagglehub pandas numpy scikit-learn
